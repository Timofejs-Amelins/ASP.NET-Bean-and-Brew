# ASP.NET Bean and Brew
 This is a coffee website where Visual studio's ASP.NET Core Web Application (Model-View-Controller) template was used to code this website. This website uses ASP.NET Core 3.1. This website has pages for ordering coffees and baked goods, information about the coffee shop, as well as social media links to my social media profiles, and pictures to help users visualise the baked goods, coffees and locations. The MVC model has been used in developing this website, and this website also has maps. The models provide the database schema, the controllers take input from the view to interact with the models, and the view import the models and rely on a controller function to provide HTML pages to the user. You will also notice that the design of these pages, and the the navbar button design is different from the default template. All this has been coded using CSS and Bootstrap. The content of the pages have been manually written in table layout.
